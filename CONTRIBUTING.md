This resource was made by the Twitch community and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/RightToBearArmsLOL/awesome-twitch/graphs/contributors).

# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

  * List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
  * Each item should be limited to one link.
  * The link should be the name of the website.
  * Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
  * Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark.
  * At least 3 items are needed to create a new category.

Please contribute links to sites/projects you have used or are familiar with, if they aren't listed already. 

If you removed our PR template you can find it [here](https://github.com/RightToBearArmsLOL/awesome-twitch/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).


## Quality standards

To be on the list, websites should adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the wider community of Twitch users
- Actively maintained
- Stable or progressing toward stable


## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have [team maintainers](MAINTAINERS). Every PR MUST be reviewed by at least two maintainers before it can get merged.

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any
information is still missing. They will wait 8 days for your interaction, after
that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes websites fall into abandonment, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes websites are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
